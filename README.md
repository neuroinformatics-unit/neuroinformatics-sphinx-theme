# Neuroinformatics sphinx theme

## Development
To test me, locally install the package with `pip install -e .` in your environment.

Then, build the test project on `/docs` with `sphinx-build -b html docs/ docs/_build/html --keep-going -w warnings.txt`.

Finally, open the `docs/_build/html/index.html` file in your browser.
